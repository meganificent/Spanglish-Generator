    4/20 (3-4:30am): toSpanishStyle(): added step 3.5 for longer sentences. Looked carefully at Spanish POS tags and tried to discern different letter meanings. Added a step for moving adjectives before nouns in toEnglishStyle() (Megan) - 1.5 hours
    4/20 (11am-1:30pm): added another rule to toSpanishStyle() to account for possessive nouns. Also created getStartNoun() to streamline some code. (Megan) - 2.5 hrs

    4/20 (7:00-8:30): fixed bugs in toSpanishStyle() and worked with Catherine a little bit to figure out a display tree typo (Megan) - 1.5 hours
    4/20 (6pm-12:30am): worked in pycharm (copied code to bottom of colab) to do user input of sentence in syntax tree function and began making pycharm game to pisplay spanglish generator; initialized the game and made text in it, then began working on converting .ps file of syntax tree to .png file to display in pygame (Catherine) - 6.5 hrs
